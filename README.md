This game was designed many years ago when I first started learning programming languages and Python. 
Looking back, some coding styles and designs may not seem ideal to me now, but it remains an enjoyable game. 

This is a simple Go game that allows three players to participate. 
The rules are identical to those of traditional Go, with the primary difference being the addition of a third player (the Blue one). 
Players of different colors are enemies to each other. They can cooperate to trap one another or try to win independently.
